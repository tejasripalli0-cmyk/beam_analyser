A Streamlit-based Beam Analyzer for structural analysis with SFD & BMD visualization.
 # beam_analyser
The **Beam analyser** is an interactive web based tool developed using **Python** and streamlit to analyse statically determinate beams.
Features are define beams of any length with **multiple supports** and various loads and applied moments and calculates **reaction forces** and generates Shear Force **(SFD)** and Bending Moment **(BMD)** diagrams.
